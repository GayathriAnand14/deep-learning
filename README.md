##It involves building a deep learning model using TensorFlow for classifying images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains grayscale images of digits (0â€“9), and the goal is to train a model that can correctly recognize and classify them.A simple neural network was created using the Keras API. The model includes:A flatten layer to convert image pixels into input features,A softmax output layer for 10-class classification.The model was trained for 5 epochs and tested on unseen data. It achieved a high accuracy (~97%), and the training and validation performance was visualized using Matplotlib.

*Tools Used*: Python,TensorFlow & Keras,Google Colab,Matplotlib

*Applications*: Handwritten digit recognition for postal automation or bank check processing,Basics of image classification used in facial recognition, object detection, and medical imaging,Foundational project for beginners learning AI and machine learning
